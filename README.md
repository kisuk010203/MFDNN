# Mathematical Foundations of Deep Neural Networks 2024 Spring
This is the homework repo.


## My tools
### `merge_pdf.py`
From the root directory, run the following code in the terminal.
```shell
python merge_pdf hw1
```
Then, it gathers all the `pdf` files inside `hw1` and merges them in alphabetical order.

### `png_to_pdf.py`
From the root directory, run the fillowing code in the terminal.
```shell
python pnf_to_pdf.py hw2/Problem\ 2_2.png
```
I should add features to let all the `png` files be turned into `pdf` but I was lazy.
